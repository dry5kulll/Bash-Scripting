# Shell
In Linux and Unix-like operating systems, a shell is a command-line interpreter that provides an interface for users to interact with the operating system. It allows users to execute commands, run programs, and perform various tasks by typing commands into a text-based interface. The shell acts as an intermediary between the user and the operating system. When you type a command into a shell prompt and press Enter, the shell interprets that command, executes it, and then displays the output. It also provides features like command history, tab completion, and scripting capabilities, allowing users to perform various tasks efficiently.
